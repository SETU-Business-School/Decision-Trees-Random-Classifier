# Decision Trees and Random Forests with Iris Dataset
### [Read the Full Article Here](https://link-to-your-article.com)

This repository contains Python code that demonstrates the implementation of Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers using the Iris dataset. The examples are built using the `scikit-learn` library and provide a clear understanding of how these powerful algorithms work.

## Overview

The code in this repository covers:
- **Decision Trees:** An interpretable machine learning algorithm that builds a model in the form of a tree structure to predict the target variable.
- **Random Forests:** An ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees and merges their predictions for more accurate and robust results.

## Code Description

### Decision Tree Classifier
This section of the code includes:
- Splitting the Iris dataset into training and testing sets.
- Training a Decision Tree classifier on the training set.
- Evaluating the model's accuracy and displaying a classification report.
- Visualizing the Decision Tree to understand how the model makes decisions.

### Random Forest Classifier
This section of the code includes:
- Splitting the Iris dataset into training and testing sets.
- Training a Random Forest classifier on the training set.
- Evaluating the model's accuracy and displaying a classification report.
- Visualizing the feature importance to understand which features contribute the most to the model's predictions.
